## Company Holidays

Company holidays are days when the entire company officially shuts its doors. We can foresee a time where there may be individuals (security and support, for example) working on company holidays. Employees should receive 2x regular pay for those days worked. We will do everything possible to spread inconvenience around an entire team (ie. not just getting the newest employee to cover). 


#### PTO: Definition

We all have unlimited PTO, a policy we implement to encourage self-care and the care of people dependent on you. While this concept originally stemmed from companies not wanting to keep track of official vacation/sick days (thus creating a financial liability), this is not our motivation for an unlimited PTO policy.

Company Holidays are not PTO days. 

#### Methodology

Because our business operations are currently located exclusively in the United States, we have used the U.S. Federal Holiday calendar as a foundation. As we expand internationally, calendars will be created on a country-by-country basis. 


#### Important days outside the company calendar

An additional benefit of unlimited PTO is the ability to take time off for holidays not accounted for in the company calendar. This could include individual/family-specific commemorations (e.g. the anniversary of a death) or religious holidays outside the Federal Government’s calendar. It is not necessary to tell your manager why you are taking PTO if for a holiday or commemoration. This section is an attempt to reassure people from all backgrounds that there is space for occasions not explicitly listed.

At some point, it will become necessary for the calendar to expand as critical masses of specific cultures/religions are represented. This should be initiated by individuals in that community itself and brought to the executive team for approval.
